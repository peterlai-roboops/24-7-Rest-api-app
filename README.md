# 24-7-Rest-api-app

What is this repository for?
A simple Rest api application, to test the running and deployment of a 24/7 always on application. Using, a load balencer, and 2 kubernates clusters of docker images containing this simple rest API application.
The idea being, we can turn 1 kubernates cluster off, upgrade it, and turn it back on, and our application would have still been running.
